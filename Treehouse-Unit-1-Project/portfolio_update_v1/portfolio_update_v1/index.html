        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I currently am working in construction, but have a desire to learn new skills and to eventually transition into technology. I have always been interested in computer programming and how computers work and have decided to advance my knowledge in this field.</p>
        <p>I am a father to an eight year old son, I am dating a wonderful and inspiring woman from Argentina, I love to cook, travel, meet new people and learn about different cultures, explore the world, and always focus on personal growth!</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to improve my knowledge of programming and eventually learn how to create:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Powerful Websites</li>
          <li>Web/Mobile Apps</li>
          <li>Travel Blog</li>
          <li>Coaching Website</li>
          <li>Financial Freedom</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By setting goals and achieving them I believe that I will be able to begin some kind of career in this field within the next six to eight months, be it on my own as an entrepreneur or under wing of another company to begin my journey</p>
